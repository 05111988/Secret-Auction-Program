# Secret-Auction-Program
The Secret Auction Program is a Python-based console application that simulates a silent auction. Participants can enter their names and bid amounts without others seeing the bids. Once all bids are entered, the program determines the highest bidder and announces the winner.
A fun and simple command-line Python program that simulates a secret auction, allowing multiple users to place bids anonymously. At the end of the auction, the program announces the highest bidder as the winner.
